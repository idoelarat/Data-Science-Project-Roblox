Welcome to our Roblox data science project, where we delve into the fascinating world of Roblox games and explore the factors that contribute to their popularity. Roblox is a widely popular online platform that allows users to create, share, and play games developed by the community. With millions of active users and a vast library of games, understanding the elements that make a game successful becomes a compelling research question.

## the research question:
"Can we predict the number of favorites a game will receive on Roblox based on features such as genre, active players, created date, and more?"

This research question aims to explore the relationship between the selected features (genre, active players, created date, etc.) and the number of favorites a game garners on the Roblox platform. By using these features as predictors, the objective is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the number of favorites a game is likely to accumulate.

To address this question, data can be collected on multiple games on Roblox, including information about their genres, active player counts, created dates, and other relevant attributes. The data can then be used to train a predictive model, such as regression or machine learning algorithms, to establish the relationship between the predictor features and the number of favorites.

The insights gained from this research question can be valuable for game developers, platform administrators, and stakeholders interested in understanding the factors that contribute to a game's popularity on Roblox. By identifying the key predictors associated with the number of favorites, it can assist in game development, marketing strategies, and decision-making processes to optimize a game's potential for attracting favorites and user engagement on the platform.
